Here’s a **structured view of the problems I’ve solved**, organized by **data structure/technique**:

---

### **1. List-Based Problems**

* Sum of a list → simple iteration
* Largest in a list → iteration and comparison
* Sum of even numbers → conditional sum
* Count odd numbers → conditional count
* Second largest in a list → tracking two variables
* Merge two sorted lists → two-pointer technique
* Rotate a list by k positions → slicing / list operations

---

### **2. String-Based Problems**

* Count vowels → string iteration
* Reverse a string → indexing / slicing
* Check if prime → numeric operations, iteration
* Factorial → numeric operations, loop
* Check palindrome → string normalization & comparison
* Count frequency of characters → dictionary for counting
* Check anagram → dictionary frequency comparison

---

### **3. Set-Based / Hashing Problems**

* Find duplicates → set for fast membership check
* Sum pairs → set for O(1) lookup
* Remove duplicates from a list → set for O(1) insertion
* Longest consecutive subsequence → set + sequence detection

---

### **4. Dictionary-Based / Frequency Counting**

* Count characters in string → dict for frequency
* Anagram problem → dict for frequency comparison

---

### **5. Technique Highlights**

* **Two-pointer** → merge two sorted lists, sum pairs
* **One-pass solution** → counting characters, sum pairs
* **Hashing / sets** → duplicates, sum pairs, longest consecutive subsequence

This layout shows:

* My **strong grasp of lists, sets, and dictionaries**.
* I’ve also touched **two-pointer and hashing techniques**.
* I haven’t yet covered **stacks, queues, linked lists**, or **graph/tree structures**, which would be next.
